    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| - | X | Least Privilege | Currently, all employees have access to customer data; privileges need to be limited to reduce the risk of a breach.|\n",
    "| - | X | Disaster recovery plans | There are no disaster recovery plans in place. These need to be implemented to ensure business continuity.|\n",
    "| - | X | Password policies | Employee password requirements are minimal, which could allow a threat actor to more easily access secure data/other assets via employee work equipment/the internal network.|\n",
    "| - | X | Separation of duties | Needs to be implemented to reduce the possibility of fraud/access to critical data, since the company CEO currently runs day-to-day operations and manages the payroll.|\n",
    "| X | - | Firewall | The existing firewall blocks traffic based on anappropriately defined set of security rules.|\n",
    "| - | X | Intrusion detection system(IDS) | The IT department needs an IDS in place to help identify possible intrusions by threat actors.|\n",

    "| - | X | Encryption | Encryption is not currently used; implementing it would provide greater confidentiality of sensitive information.|\n",
    "| - | X | Password management system | There is no password management system currently in place; implementing this control would improve IT department/other employee productivity in the case of password issues.|\n",
    "| X | - | Locks (offices, storefront, warehouse) | The store’s physical location, which includes the company’s main offices, store front, and warehouse of products, has suficient locks.|\n",
